# Assets Directory

Place your website assets here:

## Required Files

- **logo.png** - Your Palm Beach Warehouses logo (recommended size: 200x50px)
  - Used in the header
  - Should have a transparent background
  - PNG or SVG format recommended

## Optional Files

You can add additional assets as needed:
- favicon.ico
- social-preview.jpg (for social media sharing)
- property images
- background images

## Current Implementation

The header currently references:
```html
<img src="assets/logo.png" alt="Palm Beach Warehouses" class="logo-img">
```

If you don't have a logo yet, you can:
1. Use a placeholder text logo (already styled in CSS)
2. Create a simple logo using Canva or similar tools
3. Contact a designer to create a professional logo

## Favicon

To add a favicon, include this in the `<head>` of index.html:
```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="assets/favicon.png">
```
