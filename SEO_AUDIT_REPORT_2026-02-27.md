   - All location pages (5 pages: Boca, Boynton, Delray, Jupiter, Lake Worth, West Palm, Royal Palm)
   - Privacy page, Terms page
   - Action: Add `<meta name="twitter:image" content="[URL]">` to each page

   - Guide pages: warehouse-sizing (87), loading-dock (75), tenant-improvements (74), palm-beach-industrial-market (77), warehouse-vs-flex (66), how-to-lease (64), cold-storage (0)
   - Homepage (83), multiple location pages (70-80 range)
   - Action: Trim to <60 characters

3. **Meta Descriptions Too Long** - 10 pages exceed 160 characters

## DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS

### Priority 1: Add Twitter Card Images

File: All guide pages, location pages, legal pages
Add to each page's `<head>`:
```html
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://palmbeachwarehouses.com/assets/og-image.png">
```

For consistency, use same image as og:image across all pages.

---

### Priority 2: Fix Title Tag Lengths

**Template:** Keep under 60 characters, include location for locality keyword targeting

Examples:
```
Current: "How to Choose the Right Warehouse Size: Complete Guide for Palm Beach County Businesses"
Fixed:   "Warehouse Sizing Guide | Palm Beach County" (43 chars)

Current: "Loading Dock Guide: Types, Heights & Requirements for Palm Beach Warehouses"
Fixed:   "Loading Dock Guide for Warehouses | Palm Beach" (45 chars)

Current: "Warehouse & Industrial Space for Lease in Palm Beach County | Palm Beach Warehouses"
Fixed:   "Warehouse & Industrial Space | Palm Beach County" (47 chars)
```

---

### Priority 3: Fix Meta Descriptions

Keep 120-160 characters including primary keyword and CTA

Examples:
```
Current: "Complete guide to cold storage and refrigerated warehouse space in Palm Beach County. Learn about temperature zones, construction, compliance, and cost considerations for food, pharmaceutical, and floral operations." (215 chars)
Fixed:   "Expert guide to cold storage and refrigerated warehouse space in Palm Beach County. Learn temperature requirements, construction, and compliance." (151 chars)

Current: "Comprehensive guide to sizing your warehouse space in Palm Beach County. Learn how much space you need, key measurements, industry-specific requirements, and avoid costly mistakes. Expert advice from industrial real estate broker Zachary Vorsteg." (246 chars)
Fixed:   "Warehouse sizing guide for Palm Beach County. Learn space calculations, industry benchmarks, and measurements for your business needs." (139 chars)
```

---

### Priority 4: Add Image Alt Text

Review all 9 images without alt text and add descriptive, keyword-relevant alt text:

```html
<!-- Instead of: -->
<img src="warehouse.jpg">

<!-- Use: -->
<img src="warehouse.jpg" alt="Modern warehouse space for lease in Palm Beach County">
```

---

### Priority 5: Fix test.html

```html
<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">
```
